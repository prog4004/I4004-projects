These are EPROMs used on the SIM4-01 Some are intended to go with
the MP7 programmer card.
54x.BIN
 files are to run with a MP7 board to program 1702A. I do not have
 542.BIN that would have timing and control bit to program 1702 ( non-A ) 
 parts. These are the original A0540 parts.
A074x.HEX
 are what I've been able to recover of the A0740 to A0743 parts
 that were from Tom Pittman's 4004 assembler that ran on the SIM4-01.
 // A0740 to A0742 look to be in good shape but A0743 had serious bit rot.
 // I'd love to be able to find this EPROM in good shape or get the code
 // for this one. I expect to type using different thresholds to try and
 // recover remaining bits. 
 As it turns out, these are correct. With some help from Dave Roberts,
 I fixed an error in my simulator and was able to successfully run Tom's
 assembler. Instructions can be had from bitsavers in the "MCS4 user
 Manual", in Appendix F. As it seems, not all simulators properly emulate
 the 4004 properly. The stack has a mostly undocmented effect on the
 4th JMS. I does overwrite the deepest return. I just isn't clear as to
 what it over writes it with. Tom's assembler uses this overwrite to 
 change modes. Here is a quick test of your favorite simulator. This
 code is written to be compatible with Tom's assembler.
 Also, note, Tom's assembler is written to dirrectly use to program 1702A
 EPROMs for the SIM4-01. The data output is inverted from what most
 simulators expect or the output of most assmblers. Tom's output is in
 Intels BPNF format.

ONECOPY.HEX
 is code I wrote to copy EPROM to EPROM. Using A054x can take 7 minutes
 for each EPROM programed, because of the slow 110 baud transfer.
 ONECOPY can copy in 2 minutes. It expexts one to have a SIM4-01 board
 and a MP7-03 programmer board on a setup, similar to a MCB-410. Examples
 of such can be found in the Intel 4004 manual for one to make an
 interface similar to the MCB-410. It also needs the ROM output port 0
 wired to 4 LED drivers and athe TEST signal switch.
 Since the SIM4-01 only has 128 bytes of RAM, the EPROM needs to be copied
 in two passes. The LEDs are to sequence the operation. First LED after
 reset is to read the fisrt half of the master. Second to program the
 first half. The third light is to copy the second half of the master
 and the third to program the third half. Each step is sequenced by the
 TEST signal switch to the 4004.
 If there is an error detected in the RAM or in programming the program
 will light all the lights and hang. This can be cleared by a RESET. Which
 error RAM or EPROM is determined by the sequence of operation, master or
 programming.
 It runs in the left socket of the SIM4-01.
