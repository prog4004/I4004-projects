# I4004-projects
Various things I done with the 4004 using Forth.
Some programs are written in FPC  It is a public domain Forth for 16 bit IBM compatible PCs.
Some programs are written in Win32Forth  This runs on 32 and 64 bit machines.
These two mainly differ in thing like I/O. Methods for things like files are different.
I'll try to note which is which in each file.
