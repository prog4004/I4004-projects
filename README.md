# I4004-projects
Various things I've done with the 4004 using Forth.
Some programs are written in FPC  It is a public domain Forth for 16 bit IBM compatible PCs.
Some programs are written in Win32Forth  This runs on 32 and 64 bit machines.
These two mainly differ in thing like I/O. Methods for things like files are different.
I'll try to note which is which in each file. Files for FPC will be *.SEQ file for Win32forth will be *.f

The Maneuver board code is fully working. This is an early code example from a couple students of Gary Kildall.

OneCopy is code I wrote for the sim4-01 and 1702a programmer. Programming 1702As with intel code takes 7 minutes because of the serial is at 110 baud with BPNF coding. OneCopy duplicates a 1702A in about 2 minutes. It only uses the first EPROM socket of the SIM4.
