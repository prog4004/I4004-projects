ASM4004.f  I4004 assembler  needs win32Forth to fload
maneuver.f  Source code for this maneuver board project needs ASM4004.f and mnuvr_LBs.f
MANEUVER.BBN Binary file created for the I4004 from maneuver.f
mnuvr_LBs.f predefine labels for maneuver.f ( these could have been in maneuver.f but didn't want the clutter )
SIM4.f  Simulator for the I4004 loads a binary file ti simulate. Needs win32Forth
MYSIM.f Instruments and macros to run MANEUVER.BBN simulation. Needs SIM4.f, MANEUVER.BBN and win32Forth
MNVR.txt Notes I made while debugging maneuver program
